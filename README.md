# Crate Digger	


A smartphone app that recreates the record store experience by letting you dig and search through the crates of music at JiggyJamz (https://www.jiggyjamz.com/) all by the touch of your fingertips. Written entirely in JavaScript using the React Native framework and MongoDB databases.
